- **Description:**  
  This project explores the *Superstore* dataset — a retail sales dataset that includes details on orders, shipping, customers, regions, and product categories.  
  The goal is to analyze **sales**, **profit**, **discounts**, and **regional performance**, and derive actionable business insights.

- **Key Findings:**
  1. 💡 *Technology* category contributes the highest profit.  
  2. 📉 Higher *discounts* lead to reduced profit margins.  
  3. 🌍 *West region* performs best in both sales and profit.  
  4. 🚚 *Standard Class* is the most used shipping mode.  
  5. 🗓️ Sales show consistent *year-on-year growth*.

- **Tools Used:**  
  `Python`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Jupyter Notebook`
