## Dataset

- **Dataset Name:** Heart Disease Dataset  
- **File:** `heart.csv`  
- **Source:** Available in the `data/` folder of this repository.  
- **Description:**  
  The dataset contains various health-related attributes such as:
  - Age  
  - Sex  
  - Chest pain type  
  - Blood pressure  
  - Cholesterol  
  - Fasting blood sugar  
  - Maximum heart rate  
  - Exercise-induced angina  
  - And a target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

## 🧠 Objective

The main goals of this project are:
1. To perform **data cleaning** and **exploratory analysis** on the heart dataset.  
2. To **visualize correlations** and find which features most affect heart disease.  
3. To prepare the dataset for potential **predictive modeling**.

## Superstore Sales EDA

- **Description:**  
  This project explores the *Superstore* dataset — a retail sales dataset that includes details on orders, shipping, customers, regions, and product categories.  
  The goal is to analyze **sales**, **profit**, **discounts**, and **regional performance**, and derive actionable business insights.

- **Key Findings:**
  1.  *Technology* category contributes the highest profit.  
  2.  Higher *discounts* lead to reduced profit margins.  
  3.  *West region* performs best in both sales and profit.  
  4.  *Standard Class* is the most used shipping mode.  
  5.  Sales show consistent *year-on-year growth*.

  Dataset source: [Kaggle Superstore Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final/data)

- **Tools Used:**  
  `Python`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Jupyter Notebook`
